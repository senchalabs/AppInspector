1.2.0-beta-1 2013-04-08 11:20

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added support for BDD syntax, please refer to the guide "Writing tests in BDD conventions" for an introduction
    - Assertions "is", "isStrict", "isDeeply" and their opposites now work with the BDD placeholders
      generated with the new method "any"
    - Added support for "sub tests" - independent tests which have their own order of assertions. See the "subTest" method.
      Tests and assertions now form a tree structure. This is useful if you test several asynchronous processes
      in parallel and would like to see a sane order of generated assertions
    - When assertion description is omitted, Siesta now generates a sensible default text, for example:
      "1 is equal to 1", "Foo matches regexp /foo/i" etc (Thanks to Brian Moeskau for suggestion!)
    - Added `isString/isObject/isBoolean/etc` assertions, each checking the according type of the supplied value
    - Updated Selenium to 2.31.0. It includes built-in support for Safari WebDriver, so it no longer requires 
      compilation from sources

    - Fixed #574: Add filter for showing only failed assertions (button added to the assertion grid).

    [API CHANGES]
    - [BREAKING] 'overrideSetTimeout' on the Siesta.Harness class now defaults to `false`. To keep the old overriding behavior, 
      you should set it explicitly to `true`.
    - [BREAKING] when 'hostPageUrl' option is set on some test descriptor, it will now turn it's 'preload' to empty array 
      (Thanks to Brian Moeskau for suggestion!)
      (more precisely it will block the inheritance of the 'preload' option from parent descriptor/harness, 
      'preload' option still can be set to non-empty array directly on such test descriptor
      Fixed #577: By default ignore parent value and set "preload" to [] for tests with "hostPageUrl")
    - [BREAKING] The newly added "isArray" assertion replaces the previously existing private method "isArray", which was renamed to
      "valueIsArray" (if you were using that private method in your tests then rename its occurrences accordingly)
    - The "todo" method now starts a new sub-test
    - "firesOk" assertion has been completely rewritten and generalized, see the updates docs. The old signature will still be supported.
    - `willFireNTimes` assertion is deprecated and removed from the documentation, please use "firesOk" instead
    - removed deprecated and unstable Selenium RC launcher from the package, newer and more stable WebDriver launcher
      provides a drop-in replacement command-line interface
    - [BREAKING] the JSON report format was extended to reflect the tree structure of assertions. Assertions now contains "type" property,
      can be one of the following: "Siesta.Result.Assertion/Siesta.Result.Diagnostic/Siesta.Result.SubTest".
      To keep the previous behavior, filter and use only "Siesta.Result.Assertion" entries.

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed a bug in the `matchGridCellContent` that caused the method to work incorrectly with plain strings
    - Fixed #590: Siesta should handle req.status === 0 for preloading
    - Fixed #615: Allow { type : 'css', url : '...' } resource descriptors
    - Fixed a bug, that was preventing the update of the test source code in the "View sources" panel
    - Fixed #470: This bug was causing the `<Exception from launcher>While running: return Siesta.my.activeHarness.generateUnifiedPageReport()...<Exception from launcher>`
      exception when using WebDriver launcher with IE and some test has failed by throwing an exception
    - Fixed #588: Remove 1s delay after phantomjs has finalized

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - configuration of the test can now be specified in the test file itself - as the 1st or 2nd argument to the StartTest call
      (thanks to Zombeerose for this excellent suggestion!)
    
    - new action for "t.chain" - "wait"
    - new action for "t.chain" - "drag"
    - allow `t.chain` to also receive the array of steps
    - the `target` for the actions can now be also provided as function, which will be called before starting the action
    
    - `defaultTimeout/waitForTimeout` properties of the test class made configurable via harness or test descriptor

    - experimental: The iframes with the tests now can maintain certain minimal size, default value is 1024x768.
      However, this feature is disabled by default, because it causes the displacement of the whole harness UI,
      in cases when that minimal size is bigger than available size.
      See Siesta.Harness.Browser#minViewportSize and Siesta.Harness.Browser#maintainMinViewportSize

    [BUG FIXES]
